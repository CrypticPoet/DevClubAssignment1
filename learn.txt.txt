The IITD Dev Club, I believe is all about developing new stuff such as games, webapps, different applications and websites. Much in contrast to competitive coding which emphasizes more upon optimization and decreasing code complexity to achieve faster and faster execution time.

The Dev Club seems a much better place for someone such as myself as I wish to develop games and the like in the future. As a novice coder, it also offers me a more peaceful sanctity as I don't have to compete with anyone and can work at my own pace while learning peacefully.
